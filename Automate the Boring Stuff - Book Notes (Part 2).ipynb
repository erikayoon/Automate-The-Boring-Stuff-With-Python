    "## Finding Patterns of Text w/o Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "This generally increases the number of lines of code needed to write a function. Another disadvantage of this method is that it can only look for one type of pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. Find a phone number in a string (415-555-4242) where the first three characters are numbers, followed by a hyphen, three more numbers, followed by a hyphen, then four numbers. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def isPhoneNumber(text):\n",
    "    if len(text) != 12:             # Check to see if length of input is exactly 12 characters\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "    for i in range(0,3):            # Loop through the first 3 characters\n",
    "        if not text[i].isdecimal(): # If the character is not numeric, return false  \n",
    "            return False\n",
    "    for text[3] != '-':             # If the fourth character is not a hyphen, return false\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "    for i in range(4,7):            # Loop through the next 3 characters\n",
    "        if not text[i].isdecimal(): # If the charaacter is not numeric, return false\n",
    "            return False\n",

    "            return False\n",
    "    return True                     # Return True if all checks pass\n",

    "## Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions, or _regexes_ are descriptions for a pattern of text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of regex expressions:\n",
    "- \\d --> stands for a digit character\n",
    "- \\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d --> Essentially does what the isPhoneNumber() function does\n",
    "- \\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4} --> The curly brackets means \"repeat this pattern {x} many times\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Regex Objects in Python\n",
    "In order to use regex functions in Python, you need to import the re module:`import re`. Passing a string value representing your regular expression to `re.compile()` returns a regex object. This is a __built-in__ module, so there is no need to install anything extra for this. \n",
    "\n",
    "** Escape characters in Python also use the `\\` characters. Therefore, when you type something like `re.compile('\\n')`, it'll interpret that as a newline character instead of a backslash followed by a lowercase n. There are two ways around this:\n",
    "1. `re.compile(r'\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d')`   --> the `r` at the beginning marks the string as a _raw_ string and doesn't escape characters. \n",
    "2. `re.compile('\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d-\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d-\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d')` --> the first `\\` escapes the second `\\` of each character. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "phoneNum = re.compile(r'\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}')       # returns a Regex object\n",
    "mo = phoneNum.search('My number is 415-555-4242') # searches for the predefined Regex object\n",
    "print('Phone number found: ' + mo.group())        # mo.group() returns the match\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Regex Characters and Methods\n",
    "- Search for parentheses by escaping the character. Ex. `re.compile(r'(\\(\\d\\d\\d\\)) (\\d{3}-\\d{4})')\n",
    "- The pipe character, `|`, is used to match one of many expressions. ex. `re.compile(r'Batman|Tina Fey')` will match either 'Batman' or 'Tina Fey'. If both occur in the string, then the first occurrence will be returned. \n",
    "- Return the strings of *every* match in the searched string instead of just the first using `x.findall()`. \n",
    "- Optional matching with `?`. ex. `re.compile(r'Bat(wo)?man')`\n",
    "- The `?` can also indicate *non-greedy* matching. ex. `re.compile(r'(Ha){3,5}?')` will look for shortest match first instead of the default longest match.\n",
    "- Match zero or more with `*`. The group that precedes the star can occur any number of times in the text.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "batRegex = re.compile(r'Bat(wo)*man')\n",
    "mo = batRegex.search('The Adventures of Batwowowowowoman')\n",
    "mo.group() # returns 'Batwowowowowoman'\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Match one or more with `+`. The group that precedes the plus must appear at least once. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "batRegex = re.compile(r'Bat(wo)+man')\n",
    "mo = batRegex.search('The Adventures of Batman')\n",
    "mo.group() # returns None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define Your Own Characters\n",
    "- You can define your own characters using square brackets `[]`. In the following example, the character class [aeiouAEIOU] will match any vowel, both lowercase and uppercase:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "vowelRegex = re.compile(r'[aeiouAEIOU]')\n",
    "vowelRegex.findall('RoboCop eats baby food. BABY FOOD.') # returns ['o','o','o','e','a','a','o','o','A','O','O']\n",
    "```\n",
    "- You can also include ranges of letters or numbers using hyphens. ex. `[a-zA-Z0-9]`\n",
    "- Use the `^` character to match characters *not* in the character class. ex.`re.compile(r'[^aeiouAEIOU]')` will return every *except* the vowels. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Review of Regex Matching\n",
    "1. `import re`\n",
    "2. Create a Regex option using `re.compile()`. Remember to add `r` at the beginning to designate input as a raw string.\n",
    "3. Pass the string you want to search into the `x.search()` method to return a _Match_ object\n",
    "4. Use `x.group()` method to return the string of the actual matched text. \n",
